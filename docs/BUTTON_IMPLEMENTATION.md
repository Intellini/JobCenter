# Job Center Button Click Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Database Connection Updates**
- Changed from using machine ID directly to using planning ID (`mp_op_od`)
- Updated queries to fetch from `mach_planning` table
- Fixed variable references throughout the code

### 2. **Button Handler Module Created** (`/assets/js/button-handlers.js`)
- Centralized all button click logic
- Added confirmation dialogs for each action
- Implemented modal windows with iframes
- Bilingual support (Hindi/English)

### 3. **Button Configurations**

| Button | Confirmation Message | Form URL |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| Drawing | View drawing confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/drawing.php` |
| Control Chart | View control chart confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/control-chart.php` |
| Contact | Call supervisor confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/contact-supervisor.php` |
| FPQC Check | Record FPQC check confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/fpqc-check.php` |
| Alert | Report issue confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/report-issue.php` |
| Breakdown | Machine breakdown warning (irreversible) | `/jobcenter/forms/breakdown.php` |
| Testing | Record test results confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/quality-test.php` |
| Production Complete | Job completion warning (irreversible) | `/jobcenter/forms/production-complete.php` |
| Pause/Resume | Production pause/resume confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/pause-resume.php` |
| Lock | Screen lock confirmation | `/jobcenter/forms/lock-screen.php` |

### 4. **Modal Window Features**
- Each modal has a title bar with close button (X)
- Iframes load forms with job parameters (machine, planning, order IDs)
- Forms can call `parent.closeJobCenterModal()` to close the modal
- After modal closes, data refresh can be triggered

### 5. **Form Integration**
- Created sample FPQC form showing the pattern
- Forms receive parameters: `?m=[machine_id]&p=[planning_id]&o=[order_id]`
- Submit button processes data and closes modal
- Cancel button closes modal without saving

## Next Steps:

1. **Create remaining form pages** for each button action
2. **Rearrange button layout** for better tablet UX
3. **Add real-time data refresh** for production metrics
4. **Implement API endpoints** for form submissions
5. **Add operator selection/login** functionality
6. **Display actual job data** from database

## Usage:
When operator clicks any button:
1. Confirmation dialog appears
2. On "Yes", modal window opens with form
3. Form submission saves data and closes modal
4. Main screen refreshes to show updated data
