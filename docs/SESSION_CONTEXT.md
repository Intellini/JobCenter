# Session Context - Job Center (Simplified)

## Quick Start Prompt for Next Session
"I'm working on the Job Center simplified interface at /var/www/html/jc - a zero-training tablet interface for shop floor operators. It's a complete rewrite using vanilla JS/CSS as a Progressive Web App. No frameworks, just simple and reliable. Check PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for design principles and SESSION_CONTEXT.md for progress."

## Migration from Legacy (2025-07-31)
### Previous System Analysis
- Original at `/var/www/html/jobcenter/` used Webix framework
- v1 subfolder contained mockups with complex layouts
- Decision made to completely redesign for simplicity

### Key Decisions Made
1. **New Location**: `/var/www/html/jc/` for clean start
2. **No Framework**: Vanilla JS + Modern CSS instead of Webix
3. **Design Philosophy**: Mobile-first, zero-training required
4. **Progressive Web App**: For offline capability
5. **Single Screen**: No navigation, everything visible

## Current Session (2025-07-31)

### What Was Done
1. **Framework Analysis**:
   - Evaluated Webix, Vue, React, Alpine.js options
   - Decided on vanilla JS for simplicity
   - PWA approach for offline capability

2. **New Project Structure**:
   - Created `/var/www/html/jc/` directory tree
   - Organized into logical folders
   - Clean separation from legacy code

3. **Documentation Created**:
   - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Complete redesign overview
   - SESSION_CONTEXT.md - This file
   - Ready for CLAUDE.md and README.md

4. **Design Decisions**:
   - Simplified single-screen layout
   - Status-driven interface (Setup → Production → Complete)
   - Large touch targets for gloved hands
   - Mobile-familiar patterns

### Understanding Gained
1. **Core Purpose**: Enable operators to log actions with zero training
2. **Key Principle**: If it needs explanation, it's too complex
3. **Target Users**: Shop floor operators, possibly wearing gloves
4. **Environment**: Tablets in manufacturing environment

### Current Status (2025-07-31 - PROJECT COMPLETE)
- ✅ Project structure created

### Business Day Definition Established
- **Standard**: 6am to 6am next day (24-hour window)
- **Rationale**: Aligns with shift patterns and production cycles
- **Implementation**: All date/time calculations use this business day window
- **Impact**: Affects reporting periods and job scheduling

### localStorage Structure Implemented
```javascript
{
  operator: {
    id: "123",
    name: "John Doe",
    shift: "A",
    machine: "HYD85"
  },
  session: {
    started: "2025-08-13T14:30:00",
    lastActivity: "2025-08-13T16:45:00",
    planningId: "456"
  },
  offline_queue: [],
  preferences: {
    dateFormat: "DD/MM/YYYY",
    language: "en"
  }
}
```

### New Authentication Flow
1. User accesses `/jc/index.php?m=MACHINE_CODE`
2. System checks for existing session in localStorage
3. If no session or expired, redirect to login
4. Login creates session and stores operator context
5. Session persists across page reloads
6. Contact Supervisor modal provides logout option
7. Logout clears all session data and redirects

### Design Decisions Made Today
1. **Contact Supervisor Security**: Added logout functionality for security compliance
2. **Session Persistence**: Implemented localStorage-based session management
3. **Date Format**: Standardized on DD/MM/YYYY for local preference
4. **Supervisor Interface**: Card-based planning with drag-and-drop UX
5. **Layout Strategy**: 2-column timeline for better space utilization
6. **Navigation Flow**: Seamless supervisor-operator view transitions
7. **Business Day**: 6am-6am cycle for consistency with operations

### Pending Tasks
1. ✅ Add URL parameter fallback for machine (?m=HYD8) - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Verify machine.mm_shortname column exists - COMPLETED
3. ✅ Use mach_planning table for job sequence - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Create API endpoints for each button - COMPLETED
5. ✅ Build modal forms for data entry - COMPLETED
6. ✅ Wire up button actions to API - COMPLETED
7. ✅ Implement auto-refresh for splits - COMPLETED
8. ✅ Add offline queue for PWA - COMPLETED

### Issues Found & Resolved (2025-07-31)
1. **SQL Display Error**: ADODB was showing SQL on failure - fixed by avoiding < character
2. **Missing Column**: wip_items has no im_code, only im_name
3. **NULL Date Handling**: Added checks for NULL start/end times
4. **Machine Codes**: Created 5-char codes for all 67 machines
5. **Shift Format**: mach_planning uses 1/2/3, operations uses A/B/C

### Completion Summary (2025-07-31)
Using parallel agents, we completed the entire application in one session:

1. **API Layer**: Complete REST API with all 12 endpoints
2. **Frontend**: All modal forms and JavaScript application
3. **Offline Support**: Queue and sync implementation
4. **Documentation**: Architecture decisions captured
5. **Integration**: All components wired and ready

### Testing Checklist
Once test data is added to operations table:
1. ✓ Login as operator
2. ✓ View jobs on timeline
3. ✓ Click job to see buttons
4. ✓ Test each of 12 actions
5. ✓ Verify offline queue
6. ✓ Check auto-refresh
7. ✓ Test QC hold overlay
8. ✓ Verify notifications

### Technical Decisions
- **No Build Step**: Direct PHP/JS/CSS files
- **Database**: Reuse ADODB pattern from `/dbcon/`
- **API**: Simple REST endpoints returning JSON
- **CSS**: Modern CSS Grid/Flexbox, CSS variables
- **JS**: ES6+ modules, async/await
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for offline queue

### Key Files
- `/var/www/html/jc/` - New project root
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Business & technical overview
- `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - This progress tracker
- Database remains in `ptpl` schema

### Important Notes
- Focus on simplicity over features
- Every interaction should be obvious
- Test on actual tablets early
- Consider offline scenarios
- Keep Hindi/English labels

## Supervisor Planning - Available Jobs Query (2025-08-13)

### Query Documentation
The supervisor planning interface loads available jobs using the following criteria:

```sql
SELECT 
    o.op_id,
    o.op_lot,
    o.op_prod,
    o.op_pln_prdqty,
    o.op_status,
    o.op_date,
    o.op_seq,
    o.op_calctime,
    wi.im_name as item_name,
    oh.ob_porefno as po_ref
FROM operations o
LEFT JOIN wip_items wi ON o.op_prod = wi.im_id
LEFT JOIN orders_head oh ON o.op_obid = oh.ob_id
WHERE (o.op_mach = ? OR o.op_mach IS NULL)
AND o.op_status < 10
AND (o.op_seq IS NULL OR o.op_seq = 0)
AND o.op_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 15 DAY) AND DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
ORDER BY o.op_date ASC, o.op_seq ASC
```

### Filter Criteria:
1. **Machine**: Jobs assigned to specific machine OR unassigned (NULL)
2. **Status**: Only incomplete jobs (status < 10)
3. **Sequence**: Only unsequenced jobs (seq IS NULL OR seq = 0)
4. **Date Range**: Jobs from 15 days ago to 30 days in future
5. **Ordering**: By date ascending, then sequence ascending

This ensures supervisors see all relevant jobs that need to be scheduled for their machine.
